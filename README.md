I have made a website for Eurovisionsquad, a Eurovision blog and news website.

## Description

Eurovisionsquad is up and running with a different design currently, since I started this website in 2016. I made this new website for Eurovisionsquad for my first project exam while studying front-end development, and it will probably be in use soon.

## Getting Started

### Installing

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Noroff-FEU-Assignments/project-exam-1-Bekkholt
```

### See the site locally

- Clone project from git
- Open in VS Code
- Run with Live Share

### Dependencies

I have used flexbox a lot, which requires a modern browser.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to mention the Noroff teachers, my fellow students, Torstein Alvern, all the people that have given me feedback and especially the rest of the Eurovisionsquad for the support during this project.The rest of the Eurovisionsquad has helped out by watching all the steps through this process, and this website would not be the same without them.
